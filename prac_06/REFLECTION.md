# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Iâ€™ve started planning my code more deliberately before jumping into writing it. Breaking problems into smaller parts has helped reduce errors and made my debugging process more efficient.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time estimation; I always underestimate how long it will take me. I also need to improve my programming accuracy rather than relying on trial and error. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am improving my code writing and style. Using the CP1404 style guide has really helped me improve my code's flow and readability. Also, following along with the lecture examples has helped a lot. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to remember to commit to git more often and write more useful commit messages. I get lost in the coding and often forget to commit, which leads to significant gaps between commits.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Everything is pretty rock solid. I don't have anything I want to see added, as I believe there is a good blend of everything. I have recommended to other lecturers that they take notes from this class when laying out their programming classes.
