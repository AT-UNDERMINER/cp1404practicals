# CP1404 Practicals – My Programming Journey

Welcome! This repository is where I document my learning and progress through **CP1404 - Programming II** at James Cook
University. Each folder represents a week’s worth of practical work as I build my Python programming skills and deepen
my understanding of software development concepts.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

- **Name**: Damien Turner
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/AT-UNDERMINER

## 📅 Subject Info

- **Subject**: CP1404 - Programming II
- **University**: James Cook University
- **Trimester**: Tr2, Online, 2025

## 📁 What's Inside

Each folder (e.g. `prac_01`, `prac_02`, etc.) contains practical exercises, programs, and sometimes reflections from
that week. I’ve aimed to write clean, readable, and well-structured code that follows the subject’s coding standards.

### Example contents from `prac_02`:

- `score.py`: Function to return a result category based on a numeric score.
- `score_menu.py`: A menu-driven program that interacts with the user to manage and display a score.
- `temperatures.py`: Simple temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- `password_stars.py`: Password input with basic validation and a star-printing feature.
- `list_files.py`: Displays files and folders in the current directory.
- `reflection.md`: My thoughts on what I’m doing well, and what I’m aiming to improve.

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

This isn’t just about passing a subject — it’s about improving how I think, solve problems, and write code. I’m using
this space to:

- Practise good coding habits and file organisation
- Learn from mistakes and successes
- Explore new concepts weekly
- Track how my thinking evolves over the trimester

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

- Python 3.13
- Follows [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [CP1404 Style Guide](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Style-Guide)
- Version control using Git and GitHub
