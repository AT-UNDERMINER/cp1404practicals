# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Initially, they were all over the place; some were significantly over, while others were significantly under. Throughout the remaining practicals, though, I slowly dialled in and started to get some pretty close estimations.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Initially, my estimations were consistently either over or under the actual time it took me to complete the task. However, towards the end, I began to develop a sense of how long specific tasks would take me to complete. Even if the overall task took more or less time than expected, I would look at a smaller task inside a larger one and say to myself that it will take x amount of time, and I would get pretty close. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Initially, I would always underestimate the amount of time required, and no matter how small a task seemed, it always took more time than I thought. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned how valuable it is to get a second perspective. Reviewers pointed out areas where I could simplify or improve my code structure, use better naming conventions, and handle edge cases that I had not considered or overlooked due to practical information.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing other peopleâ€™s code helped me recognise mistakes I also made in my own code. It also gave me ideas about how to implement things more efficiently or clearly. Explaining feedback helped me understand concepts more deeply.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review of jd115406's prac_09](https://github.com/jd115406/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

In this code review, I addressed all the feedback I have received from past code reviews. I produced what I believe to be my best review yet, providing precise and detailed in-line comments on potential improvements and best practices for code, as well as offering an overall comment at the end of the review.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review of Miss-Tired-Ghost's prac_06](https://github.com/Miss-Tired-Ghost/CP1404-Practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

This was my second-best code review, providing some feedback on the code. I was still getting the hang of conducting the review and incorporating feedback to improve my review style. I still think it was not a bad review, but it could be improved. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would not change anything about the practicals themselves. I thought they were exceptionally well-structured, laid out, and explained in a very detailed and goal-oriented way. I have even made suggestions to the heads of other engineering programming classes to take some notes from this class to set up their subject for student success. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I applied the subject's teachings effectively to the practicals and did my best to learn everything I could from them. However, overall, the best thing I did was improving my programming abilities to the point where I feel comfortable with Python, even though I had never used it before this class.
