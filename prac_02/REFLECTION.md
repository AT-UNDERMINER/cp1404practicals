# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched all the lecture videos from Weeks 1 and 2 as well as some of the lecture videos from Week 3.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

With how my timetable is laid out this trimester, Mondays are my allocated CP1404 day. I try to watch all the lecture
videos, take notes and complete the practical for the week. If I have spare time on the weekend I try to get a bit
ahead.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I find how I am handling the workload and managing my time is working well so I will continue with that.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to change my git commits to follow correct convention and structure.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Most likely variable naming convention is not always correct. I also overlook specifics of the correct structure and
layout but hopefully with practice through the remaining practicals that will get better.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I think my want to make my practicals better is what I'm doing well. For example the "score_menu.py" exercise, I went
with the option to import the function from "score.py" instead of copying and pasting it into the new file. However,
this led me to an issue where the main() in the "score.py" file would also run when running the "score_menu.py" program.
So I did some reading through the textbook and found how to fix that even though I didn't explicitly see that fix in any
of the lecture videos.
